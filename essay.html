When the dot moves in two-dimensional space, the path it undertakes forms a line. These are still the basic units of defining space. The line is significantly transformative as it enables us to transcend two-dimensional planes. I am particularly interested in how the understanding of aspects of graphic design can help foster a new outlook on the world. For instance, the Earth isn’t flat. Although I am also never surprised as to why people contend this position as we have also created a tendency to obstruct our understanding of both how big and small the world truly is.  

In Hito Steyerl’s In Free Fall: A Thought Experiment of Vertical Perspective, Steyerl briefly defines the horizon as the literal dividing line of land/water and sky. The horizon in this case may also be used as a signifier of our incoming futures. The future waits for us as the horizon indicates where we can go, how far we have to go, even an estimated time of arrival. Although most notably, the perspective of horizontality—that is to look directly into the open world—generates an overall sense of position. By momentarily keeping still and having our eyes’ navigate through space, we’ve temporarily artificially stabilized the Earth, both consciously and subconsciously capturing images of time. We often refer to these images in our memory, and we refer to them otherwise as signifiers of the past. We store glimpses of time, often referring to them as anecdotal logs of experiences. The horizon in this case is a commonly used artificial tool that we refer to in the aids of representations of time and space, guiding us towards the construction of form and meaning. 

But the perspective of horizontality is now being accompanied with the perspective of verticality. Contemporary media and visual art is now being supplemented with aerial surveillance and/or drone generated imagery. For instance, technologies such as Google Maps and Earth has enabled a means of control and overview. By enabling the user the perspective of a standardized God’s eye view, one can only wonder: we’re probably not meant to perceive the world in this manner. The horizon disappears in an aerial perspective for we are simply looking at a ground. The ground acts as a barrier, like a wall that cannot be mathematically climbed. Since the vanishing point cannot be identified, the ground has now reverted back to its two-dimensional form and the viewer is this case appears as if he or she is floating. This becomes an act of looking down at yourself and acknowledging your existence, as if there were a barrier surrounding the world reflecting the image backward onto the Earth. Though to where there is a state of floating, there is also the state of falling. In the state of falling one loses all sense of orientation, where he/she has entered a state in which he/she no longer knows if they are beings or objects. It treats us as accessories and eliminates the aspects for which make us human.



Panofsky also examined the state of comprehending representational space and the conditions that come with it. For instance, while visual perspective is extremely dependent on being able to see straight lines the fact is that our eyes are curved planes. What is true reality then? Homogeneous space then is never given space rather it is space produced by construction: as perception does not know the concept of infinity; from the very outset it is confined within certain spatial limits imposed by our faculty of perception. Within a homogeneous space, above is no different from below, left is equivalent to right and behind is inherently the same as ahead. A line is in fact a two-way street with two distinct points of beginning and end, rotating it though doesn’t change the path whatsoever.

The current visual paradigm encourages the division of our world, whether that is through horizontal or vertical borders, and the fact is we’re almost conditioned to keep looking straight. How can we see the horizontal division of the world without an aspect of elevation? The act of looking down is only possible if one is elevated from the ground, or at the very least is in a position of power. We’re never reminded to look up, and why would we? We’re so distracted on the first floor by all sorts of things that we’ve failed to acknowledge the fact that a powerful few are constantly looking down at us. We can’t directly see this division, and so the division of vertical borders then can be manifested as a technological division.

The cloud is an interesting aspect of technology as it is nebulous and ghostly in nature. In The Prehistory of the Cloud, Tung-Tui Hu suggests that while the cloud doesn’t have a definite shape, as it projects itself as an amorphous network, it does also somehow possess an infrastructure. The cloud is a byproduct and evolution of the Internet, which was initially built within a pre-existing infrastructure that we’ve built to define space. Railroads, pre-existing databases, sewer systems—just to name a few for which impact the way we connect and understand what the contemporary cloud is. Though, if the Internet were grafted on a pre-existing infrastructure that we humans have built, is it at fault for its own rapid rate of expansion? The internet multiplies by the second, storing both cool and useless junk that we’ve both individually and collectively generated. An act that has become extremely prevalent and particularly necessary, the digital enables us to share time. Why is it that we’ve come to archive things in artificial space? Is it because these digital files are non-existent to begin with? These digital files are easily accessible, seemingly hovering above our heads like clouds of ideas patiently waiting to be used, appearing as if they are simply occupying air. 

The cloud nonetheless represents a self-referential map in which you adopt the dominant perspective. Everything revolves around you for you. It emphasizes and minimizes the user for it enables you a sense of privacy, that is before you realize you’re truly just in a separate stall. The cloud enables us to timeshare—that is to collect a fragment of a larger and global network and define it as a personal task, at the very least the illusion of it. The term personal computer can be referred to as the moment in which computers inherently morphed into a form of leisure. 

Nevertheless, I enjoy having these digital windows open for my disposal. It still gives me a means to define my own time—that is to document things from the past, to act on the present as well as plan for the future. The search bar encourages discovery by self-navigation to whereas the cursor in itself is a signifier of position. But why artificial space? Probably because the Earth is finite space. The Earth existed before us to whereas the cloud came after. As such, we’ve managed to design this amorphous network to depict limitless non-vanishing artificial space. The Internet expands at a physically unsustainable rate, we archive just in case the world goes at war and we have to start over again. And so while we are all still temporarily connected and tangled, we might as well connect all things. The Internet then as Hu mentions, manifests itself as a state of desire. 

Similar to how we cannot investigate the cloud without diving into the Internet as a whole, Bridle suggests a simply functional understanding of systems is insufficient; one needs to be able to think about histories and consequences too. For instance, where did these systems come from, who designed them and what for, and which of these intentions still lurk today?. Very often the response to our inability to keep up with technology is that we should increase the development of technological education. That should work, right? But that’s the thing—this would also then foster solutionism and/or computational thinking, otherwise the belief that any given problem can be solved by the application of computational thinking. It suggests that there is one standardized solution to the root of almost every problem, similarly as to how the arrival of central perspective catapulted it to a source of truth. People are hungry and don’t want to leave the house? Oh, let’s build an app for it.  This presupposes that the world is pre-structured and that it can only then be comprehended through means of computation. Bridle says: if philosophy is that fraction of human thought dealing with that which cannot be explained by the sciences, then systemic literacy is the thinking that deals with a world that is not computable, while acknowledging that it is irrevocably shaped and informed by computation.

We’ve also naturally expanded on the surface of the Earth, exploring it’s depth, outlining and defining its space to then acknowledging this action as progress. Whether we moved left or right to establish new worlds, up or down (that is through construction of buildings or through means of acts such as mining), we collectively occupy, fix and transform space. We simultaneously use the Earth as a canvas and as we zoom out to look down only then can we see what has been collectively drawn. While aerial perspective illustrates a perspective of verticality, one that appears to have no future, I’d like to add that one could also look at state of the Earth and argue that it is in fact already in a state of stagnation. The Earth represents an ongoing act of architecture, adjusting, creating and appointing rooms to all. On the surface of the Earth may just be one giant improvised doodle that saw a dot vicariously explore a plane with the idea of time in mind. 

Additionally, if the Internet was reflective of our collective state, could we also be put to blame? We’ve been naturally conditioned to look linearly and our reliance on sight is reflective in everyday things such as visual communication, media, etc. Of what use would an iPhone or MacBook be to a person of no sight? Our eyes enabled us to see and around the same time we thought we were designed to think, came the idea that what we saw was an indicator of both subjective and objective truths of reality. What do you see? I see this, I see that, it looked like this, kind of like that. Did it matter? Probably, probably not. We’ve been both blessed and cursed with the act of thinking, and as a result an explosion of new perspectives came about. The act of reading itself is linear, we comprehend a combination of glyphs in order to perceive and signify a collective meaning. I also hope I’m not getting off track here, so let’s keep moving forward.

Linear perspective can be identified as the pre-dominant visual paradigm that has transformed the way we comprehend visual art and everyday life. Walking into the AGO to briefly look at Peter Rubens’s artwork—I tried my best to not look at The Massacre of the Innocents. Everyone writes about it at some point, but the painting is so damn gorgeous. And it is still the 39th most expensive painting in the world. Nevertheless, It was saved for the near ending of the exhibition and rightfully so. Rubens narrates the tragedy with the use of his brush, I was so compelled at how this painting visually made sense. He depicts everyone as still yet in motion, as my attention moved forward navigating itself within the canvas; as if I made the characters in the painting move myself. I look at this painting and it’s as if there was a big crowd in a public street and someone took a panoramic image of the entire situation, except the image is gorgeous and actually isn’t all distorted and funny looking. His understanding of space is almost as if it were computed. The painting relies on the observer and the state of artificial stabilizing in order to comprehend the painting’s narrative and structure. 

There’s always a notion of exploring but what is it for? This encourages self-agency, as on Instagram there’s a literal explore page while Twitter has its own discover page. We are jumping from world to world seamlessly, from window to window, stall by stall. There is a constant desire to always find something new. In James Bridle’s New Dark Age: Technology and the End of the Future’s introduction he briefly elaborates: if we do not understand how complex technologies function, how systems of technologies interconnect, and how systems of systems interact, then we are powerless within them, and their potential is more easily captured by selfish elites and inhuman corporations. Precisely because these technologies interact with one another in unexpected and often-strange ways, and because we are completely entangled with them… In YouTube’s case we navigate and start at a seemingly innocuous space. We then notice that there is a suggestion or a video in queue, evoking an endless act of clicking and viewing. A series of automated videos are resulting in a state of paranoia and political instability. In this case, by seemingly moving forward in digital space and through the accidental manipulative nature of the algorithm, we tend to lose control. We are initially given a sense of position only to lose it at some point along the way. We lose sense of navigation through the rigorous nature of the algorithm, which has preconstructed a path that values and mimics self-agency. You can click me but you don’t have to, unless you want to. And I guess that’s the thing, I myself more often than not actually want to. I revert this concept back to the over production of simulated worlds, rooms or spaces of no specified future. They encourage you to move forwardly, where they otherwise generate or assign self-position, a ground to stand by.

Briefly going through David Reinfurt’s A New Program for Graphic Design, the introduction depicts a conversation between a printer and a man. The printer suggests that while he believes that the computer has plenty of potential, all the knowledge that he has learned and mastered for 26 years is also now all but locked up in a computer. This transformation and simplification of things is still ongoing. Similarly as to how the cloud is a mixture of land, satellite and network, the iPhone screen is a mixture of keyboard, screen and virtual time. More personally, exactly what year would it be when everyone just starts using Adobe Creative Suite templates? How many poster generators would exist in the future? Nonetheless, I guess this is no worse than how the printer felt with the introduction the computer.
